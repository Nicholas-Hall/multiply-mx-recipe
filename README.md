## Multiply Recipes Requirements

Multiply has a recipe site.  This site displays a single recipe currently -- Chocolate Chip Cookies.  We need to add a feature that allows users to anonymously add comments on any of the recipe steps or ingredients.  Further, the ability for any user to anonymously upvote a comment must be available.

The comments and votes do not need to be visible to other users on the site, but it would be a nice-to-have if they persisted for the given browser's session.

You can be as creative as you wish as to how you implement these features.  The finished app may or may not be styled.
